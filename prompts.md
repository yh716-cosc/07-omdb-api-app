## Design Prompt
Build a dark-themed, responsive movie search page with a header (including an icon and title), a centered search bar, and two sections for results and a watchlist. Use a grid of cards for displaying movie information (poster, title, and year) with buttons to add/remove movies. Add subtle hover effects and a simple footer.

## Prompt 1
Fetch movies from the OMDb API when the user searches, and display each movie's poster, title, and release year inside the movie results grid.

## Prompt 2
Modify the JavaScript so that clicking an 'Add to Watchlist' button adds the movie to the watchlist section. The watchlist should not contain duplicates.

## Prompt 3
I want all the movies in my watchlist to stay there even after refreshing the page.
